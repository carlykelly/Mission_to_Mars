# Mission_to_Mars

The project in this repository is an assignment completed for The George Washington University Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp.

Beautiful soup is used to scrape multiple webpages about mars and store that information in an object on MongoDB. HTML is then used to pull the information from MongoDB and created a website that displays the data scraped from the web.
